        <p>
            I had recently learned about Strict Mode before but I didn't know that it was directly related to debugging within the program, something different I learned is that it can be easily used in functions just by adding the line of code 'use strict', Strict
            mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function: function strictly(){ 'use strict'; } but it is usually put on top of the file to ensure fewer errors and changes to be understood better. Another very basic way to use is the
            confidence alert that can be used mostly to debug functions, it does not have such a high range of benefits but in a short test it is used to visualize
        </p>
        <p>Using the Console can be another more practical way to find errors within the code, it can be invoked at any stage of the program, although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does. function amIOldEnough(age){
            <br> console.log(age);
            <br> if (age
            < 12) {<br>
                console.log(`In the if with ${age}`);<br> return 'No, sorry.';<br> } else if (age
                < 18) {<br>
                    console.log(`In the else-if with ${age}`);<br> return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';<br> } else {<br> console.log(`In the else with ${age}`);<br> return 'Yep, come on in!';<br> }
                    <br> }
