        Week 2
    </h1>
    <div class="container-text">
        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>This week the concept that caught my attention was Destructuring Arrays which consists in assigning values respectively with the index assigned in an array. <strong>Example:</strong>const [x,y] = [1,2];</p>
        <p>Also functions that I am willing to handle fully .map() and .filter() I personally do not know their full potential although I have used them I feel they can be of more use. some examples of map <br>and filter: [1,2,3].map( x => 2 * x);
            << [2,4,6] ..../ const numbers=[ 2, 7, 6, 5, 11, 23, 12 ]<br> numbers.filter(x=> x%2 === 0 );<br> // this returns true if the number is even
                <br>
                << [ 2, 6, 12 ]</p>
                    <h2>Question:</h2>
                    <p>I have a project that is stopped because I don't know how to execute a function that deletes several "div" with the same class name,<br> these div were generated by a button that activated a ForEach to create the elements from a json
                        file, any suggestions?
