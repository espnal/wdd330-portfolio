        Week 9

    <div class="container-text">
        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>There are three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: <strong>alert(), confirm() and prompt()</strong>. These are not part of the ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as methods of the window object.</p>
        <p>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned: <br> window.alert('Hello');
            <br>
            << undefined <br>
                The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and
                false if the user clicks Cancel: <br> window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?'); <br>
                << undefined <br>
                    The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks
                    OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned: <br> window.prompt('Please enter your name:');<br>
        </p>
        <p>One window function that I have found quite useful is window.setTimeout(), it provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.<br> The window.setTimeout() method
            accepts a function call as the first parameter and a number of milliseconds as the second parameter. <br> window.setTimeout( ( () => alert("Time's up!"), 3000);<br>
            << 4<br>

                The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.<br> const summon = window.setInterval(chant,1000);<br>
                << 6<br>
        </p>
        <p>Something new I learned is that the data-attribute is a way of embedding data into a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They are also private to a page, so they are not intended to be used by an external service
            - their only purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means that they are perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program uses to access information about a particular element on the page. Start with data-.<br>            Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.<br> Include an optional string value.<br> exm:

            <br> data-powers = 'flight superSpeed<br> data-rating = '5 <br> data-dropdown <br> data-user = 'DAZ <br> data-max-length = '32'<br>
        </p>
    </div>
