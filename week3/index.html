    <h1>
        Week 3
    </h1>
    <h2>Notas:</h2>
    <p>Something that I really liked, what I learned this week is how you can simplify the syntax in a more summarized way to consume less resources, at first it is confusing but it is a matter of time to adapt and understand everything a clear example is:
        how from an object you can get specific data with the following statement: <br><br> const birthdate = inventors.sort(function(a, b) { <br> if(a.year
        < b.year) {<br> return -1; }<br> else { return 1; } });<br> console.log(birthdate );<br> <br> the same result is obtained with this one too: <br> const birthdate = inventors.sort((a, b)=> (a.year
            < b.year) ? 1 : -1)</p><br>
                <p></p>
                <h2>Question:</h2>
                <p>There's no question so far
                </p>
