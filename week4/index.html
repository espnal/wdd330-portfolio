        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>Several things caught my attention from what I learned this week, first how to directly import an anonymous function in a single line of code, I think it will be very useful, the following example explains it in a better way: <br> module.exports
            = x => x * x;</p>
        <p>Working with forms, there are modules available to access their values and work directly with them and we can also declare variables with the attributes it contains for example:<br> const [input,button] = form.elements;</p>
        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>How can i import several functions or data from a single file?
